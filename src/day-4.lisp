;; Challenge 4: A perfect fit

;; Being happy with your work from yesterday, Santa asks you to do even more research: This time,
;; he wants to have an idea of how much magic he needs to use in order to teleport his presents
;; down each persons chimney. When asking how to calculate the amount of magic required, Santa says:

;; â€œWell, if the present fits through the chimney, it does not require any. If it does not,
;; the present needs to be teleported. In that case, the amount of magic required is equal
;; to the volume of the present.

;; Task

;; You are to design a function, that takes the following arguments:

;;     W - the width of the chimney.
;;     H - the height of the chimney.
;;     X - the length of the present.
;;     Y - the height of the present.
;;     Z - the depth of the present.

;; The function should return the amount of magic required to get the present through the chimney.

;; Important thing to remember: A present can be rotated in order to fit through!
