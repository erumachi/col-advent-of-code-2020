;; Challenge 2: Hot off the press

;; The christmas shop is grateful for your previous work, and would like for you to repair more of their broken machines. This time, they would like you to automate their product tallying. However, seeing as their other machines are still broken, the input format is less than ideal: You will be given a text file containing a bunch of charactersâ€¦
;; Task

;; Your task is to design a program/function that returns a list of numbers, given the name/location of a text file as input.

;; The file itself will consist of 4 lines, that look something like this:

;; BBBBBBBBBBBB
;; MMMMMMM
;; CCCCCCCCCC
;; T

;; Where each line represents the amount of items in an order. In this instance, the order contains 12 balls, it was placed in July, contains 10 cookies and a tree.

;; Your output will be a list of numbers, where each number in the list represents the amount of a particular item.
